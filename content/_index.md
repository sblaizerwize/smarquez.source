# **Projects**
- **Video streaming services** \
    Integration of a streaming platform into STB devices. I created how-to guides that helped newcomers configure their devices and routers. I also supported the quality testing team and carried out project management tasks. The development team worked with JavaScript, RESTful APIs, and AWS Athena.

- **Financial services** \
    Migration of a legacy-based financial system into a microservice-based architecture. I created how-to guides that helped developers to connect to databases, monitor resources, manage parameters, deploy applications using Octopus, and query data using AWS Athena. I produced glossaries, policies, and user guides and implemented a Docs-like-Code approach to deliver technical documentation in a static site powered by Hugo and hosted in GitLab Pages.

- **Dating services** \
    Integration of BlueSnap, Stripe, and Apple Pay payment processors with customer services. I created sequence diagrams and API documentation that helped developers to understand the flow of payment transactions for payment processors, including Stripe, BlueSnap, and Apple Pay.

# **Open Source**
I contributed to the Open Source Initiative (OSI) at Wizeline by conducting the followings tasks:

- Analyzed existing OSIs from third-party companies to define the OSI at Wizeline
- Helped on the design of the OSI guidelines at Wizeline by defining and documenting the main contribution pathways: getting to know OS, using OS, contributing to OS, and creating a new OS project. 
- Supported the launching of the [first open source project at Wizeline](https://github.com/WizelineLabs/gitwize-fe) on the documentation side by creating the README files of the project’s repositories
- Created a [repository](https://github.com/WizelineLabs/template) containing documentation and licenses that served as a template to generate new open source projects at Wizeline
- Created a Kanban board to organize, prioritize and keep tracking of tasks on the documentation side. This strategy fostered the collaboration and contribution of a team of three TWs to the Open Source initiative

# **Presentations**
- *TW Academy at Wizeline (Spring 2022)* 
    - Lecturer of the session How to Write Software Architectures. I created and delivered the material for this session in a video format for on-demand studying. 
    - Mentored two students 

- *TW Academy at Wizeline (May 2021)* \
    Mentored one student. Some responsibilities included: review assignments, have weekly one-on-one sessions to provide training and best practices, assess the student’s cultural fit, and complete the student's rubric.

# **Leadership Initiatives at Wizeline**

- I led a study group of 16 technical writers for three months to pursue the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification. Some activities included: define and organize study materials, coordinate study sessions, create questions that fostered discussions, and give demos.

- I mentored three technical writers joining the TW team for six months. Some activities included: conduct peer reviews, support their career growth, identify opportunity areas and how to cope with them, and help them unblock any stoppers.

- I led the TW onboarding squad for one year. Primary responsibilities included: send a welcome email to new technical writers along with a handful of useful resources to get onboarded, revamp the TW style guide assessment, and provide guidance to TW team leads on how to support their mentees.
